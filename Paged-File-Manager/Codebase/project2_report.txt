Student ID# of Submitter:
Name of Submitter: 
ID#s and Names for others on the Team


2. Catalogs/Metadata

- Show your catalog design (Tables and Columns tables), and the information about each column in those catalogs.
- How do you distinguish catalogs (which can't be changed by Insert, Update and Delete statements) from other tables?


3. Internal Record Format

- Show your record format design, and describe how your design satisfies O(1) field access. If not, just mention that your team hasn't implemented this feature.
- Describe how you store a VarChar field.
- Describe how you deal with update of a VarChar field.


4. Page Format

6. Implementation Detail

Other implementation details goes here.  For example:  
- Describe your use of Forwarding Addresses, including what happens when a Forwarding Address needs to be forwarded yet again to another page.
- Describe how a scan is done, touching each record exactly once even when there are Forwarding Addresses.
- Describe how you determine that a previously slot on a page is empty (after record is deleted), so that the slot can be re-used for another record.  (Yes, a record's rid is supposed to be permanent, but only while the record exists.)


7. Other (optional)
